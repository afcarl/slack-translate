# Slack Translate Bots and Commands

This repo provides a bot which can be translate languages many-to-one inside of
Slack, as well as a translation slash-command implementation using Google Cloud
Functions (though this will be ditched soon in favor of one bot handling
everything, see README in command folder).

See READMEs in `bot/` and `command/`
